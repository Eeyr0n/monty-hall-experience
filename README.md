# monty-hall-experience

This Monty Hall Python program is my first program every made by myself only.
I tried to do it since the Monty Hall Problem really intrigued me and so I tried to apply the game to my current python coding skills and see to myself if switching really make your chances higher in picking the car.

If you recognize any mistakes in my code, feel free to tell me. This would be a huge learning opportunity for me regarding my coding skills
